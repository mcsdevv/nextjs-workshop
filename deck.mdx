# Next.js

## The easiest way to develop React apps

---

### Created to make SSR React simple out of the box

#### Custom SSR solutions often end up as Next.js

---

### SSR where needed, else export statically

---

### Webpack and Babel configuration taken care of

#### #1 source of issues are custom Babel configurations

---

### File system routing by default

#### No need to include further dependencies

---

### Dynamic routing using `[slug].js`

#### Render different data dependent on the context

---

### API Routes for server-side functionality

#### Just use `pages/api` to get started
